<b>About me:</b> I'm a recent computer science graduate with a heavy interest in applying the power of recent deep learning systems to unique problems. Historically my research has revolved around conditional image generation, specifically colorization of 2D images in cartoon domains, but I'm also very invested in and have experience with utilizing from-scratch neural networks as creature brains and evolving them towards some very cool tasks!

<b>Previously:</b> 
I received my M.S. in Computer Science from Northwestern Univeristy, advised by Dr. Aggelos Katsagellos. During the summer and fall of 2022 I interned at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center under Dr. Stephanie Schollaert Uz and Troy Ames. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Louisiana State University.
